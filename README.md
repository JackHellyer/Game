# Game

Game is a basic pvp game, if one player shoots the other, the player that is shot loses 10 hp, if they lose all their hp (100)
they die and the player that killed them gains 100 exp. The more exp a player gets they level up, if they get to level 4 they 
can now shoot 4 bullets at one. 

Features that work:
player can't leave the map

player and bullet collision works

player aim and shooting works

doesn't allow multiple usernames

chat system works

username sent with each message

respawn after player dies works

Partially working features:

log in and sign up partially work, if you close the game without logging out, the next time you visit the home page you have to press logout and then refresh again. if you log in and then log out and then log in again, nothing appears on the canvas, you have to refresh to have the player and map drawn

exp and level system work but reset everytime a user joins the game

Future additions
add proper sprites e.g they change when the player is moving or shooting

players get to choose they sprite from a list of around 5

add enemies, could have a player v enemy 

add a map with things players can hide behind
