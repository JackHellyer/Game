# Game

Game is a basic pvp game, if one player shoots the other, the player that is shot loses 10 hp, if they lose all their hp (100)
they die and the player that killed them gains 100 exp. The more exp a player gets they level up, if they get to level 4 they 
can now shoot 4 bullets at one. 

Features that work:
player can't leave the map.
player and bullet collision works
player aim and shooting works
log in and sign up work
doesn't allow multiple usernames
chat system works
username sent with each message
respawn after player dies works

Partially working features:
exp and level system work but reset everytime a user joins the game

Future additions
add proper sprites e.g they change when the player is moving or shooting
players get to choose they sprite from a list of around 5
add enemies, could have a player v enemy 
add a map with things players can hide behind
